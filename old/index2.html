The right side shows republican donations. Greg Hoberock is on a separate scale because he donated much more than the others, around $448,000 in all, all towards Republican causes save for $1,500 to Democratic recipients. The order of total donated goes as follows. Graham: 55,700, vastly Democratic. Graves: about $44,000 fully Republican.  Layman: $32,000 Republican and $5,250 Democratic. Brncic: about $17,500 Republican and about $9,200 Democratic. Wenneker: about $7,200 Republican and $9,900 Democratic. Williams: $3,800 Republican and about $11,300 Democratic. Holloway: $5,600 Republican. Chatman no donations. Graves leads all with nonpartisan donations at $9,900, the rest around $1,000 or below."></div></a>

The L2 position is the place where it will begin orbiting the earth.The graphic then contextualizes how far away the M82 galaxy is from Earth, a distance of 12 million light-years.

In 2020, numbers drop dramatically from 2million in the beginning of March to around 200,000 by the end of March. Below the area line chart, a smaller area line chart shows the number of COVID-19 cases during the same time span. In a new section, a headline reads ‘Lower load factor on planes leads to lower average airfares.’  Load factor is essentially the percentage of seats filled on a plane. Three individual line charts show how a drop in load factor in 2020 and a drop in operating revenue in 2020 lead to a drop in average airfare by nearly 29% from the previous quarter in 2019. One final section shows how Missouri airports were impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. Airports in Columbia, St. Louis and Kansas City all see almost exactly the same trend, where total traffic drops nearly 100% in April and slowly recovers from then on."></div></a>
