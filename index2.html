          <h3>D3 Choropleth Map</h3>
            <p>I've started learning the D3 library, and I've built up enough knowledge to understand basic D3 syntax and learn how to make most basic visualizations fairly quickly.</p>

          <h3>Full-page spread on COVID-19 and airline industry</h3>
            <p>I created a full-page infographic spread for the Columbia Missourian about how COVID-19 impacted the airline industry. It won the Missouri Press Association's <strong> Best Infographic </strong> award for 2020. I analyzed all the data used for the project, as well. The spread was a semester-long project I worked on while learning the basics of data visualizations and graphic design.</p>

          <h3>Half-page on record-breaking high school golfer</h3>
              <p>I recreated Tolton High School golfer Audrey Rischer's record game where she carded a 60 for a par-72 course. I designed and created everything, from drawing each hole on the course to plotting the strokes based roughly on the scorecard provided to the paper by Tolton High School.</p>

          <h3>Website about pollution in Louisiana</h3>
            <p>I designed and coded a webpage that provides an overview of pollution in Louisiana. I used Datawrapper to create choropleth maps and used the Vega-lite JavaScript library to create two symbol maps. In that process, I learned how to transform CSV files into topoJSON files. I also learned the Vega-lite language and have continued to develop in the library.</p>

          <h3>Mizzou Homecoming schedule full-page</h3>
              <p>I designed a full page spread on all the major events occuring for Mizzou's Homecoming 2021. Along with the other graphics editor, I oversaw a 10-plus graphics package for the Missourian's special section on Homecoming and worked with the designer on establishing a consistent theme for the section.</p>

          <h3>Windfarm locator map</h3>
            <p>I was assigned what appeared as a simple locator map. However, I worked closely with the reporter in gathering all the acreage map data for land leased to a company creating a windfarm across two Missouri counties. The acreage maps weren’t online, so I had to use physical images of the acreage maps taken by the reporter from Howard County’s acreage map book.</p>
            <p>I traced over each individual piece of land and ensured that each trace was proportional, as the images were taken at different distances and angles. I’m especially proud of this graphic, as it hides all that complexity with a simple and clear design.</p>

            <h3>Data analysis on vaccines in rural Missouri counties</h3>
            <p>Alongside the other graphics editor, we worked with the Columbia Missourian’s state government section in providing data analysis for a story they pitched on the state of vaccinations in rural counties. The data analysis helped guide them towards which counties they wanted to visit and report on. We also assigned members of the graphics section to different graphics to create a package to run with the story.</p>
            <p>There was a bunch of behind-the-scenes visualizations that I used to find any trends and potential leads for the story. I heavily used Tableau for exploratory graphics, and we published the following Tableau chart with the story</p>
