      <h3>Full-page spread on COVID-19 and airline industry</h3>
      <p>I created a full-page infographic spread for the Columbia Missourian about how COVID-19 impacted the airline industry. I analyzed all the data used for the project, as well. The spread was a semester-long project I worked on while learning the basics of data visualizations and graphic design.</p>

        <h3>Website about pollution in Louisiana</h3>
        <p>I designed and coded a webpage that provides an overview of pollution in Louisiana. I used Datawrapper to create choropleth maps and used the Vega-lite JavaScript library to create two symbol maps. In that process, I learned how to transform CSV files into topoJSON files. I also learned the Vega-lite language and have continued develope in the library.</p>

    <h3>Windfarm locator map</h3>
    <p>I was assigned what appeared as a simple locator map. However, I worked closely with the reported in gathering all the acreage map data for land leased to a company creating a windfarm across two Missouri counties. The acreage maps weren’t online, so I had to use physical images of the acreage maps, taken by the reporter from Howard County’s acreage map book.</p>
    <p>I traced over each individual piece of land and ensured that each trace was proportional, as the images were taken at different distances and angles. I’m especially proud of this graphic, as it hides all that complexity with a simple and clear design.</p>

    <h3>Data analysis on vaccines in rural Missouri counties</h3>
      <p>I worked with the Columbia Missourian’s state government section in providing data analysis for a story they pitched on the state of vaccinations in rural counties. The data analysis helped guide them towards which counties they wanted to visit and report on. I also I assigned and overviewed members of the graphics section to different graphics to create a package.</p>
      <p>There was a bunch of behind-the-scenes visualizations that I used to find any trends and potential leads for the story. The end result was that there weren’t any major trends, teaching me a valuable lesson: There’s often not a clear-cut trend in data.</p>

    <h3>Bike boom during COVID-19</h3>
      <p>I was a reporter during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wrote a feature story on Columbia’s bike boom, which was spurred because of citywide/nationwide lockdown orders. It was also a collaborative piece, as a peer reporter helped gather interviews for the piece. I wrote the text of the story.</p>
