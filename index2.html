      <h3>Full-page spread on COVID-19 and airline industry</h3>
      <section class="img_clips">
      <img src="airline2.PNG" alt"A graphic spread detailing the negative impact COVID-19 had on the airline industry">
      </section>
        <p>I created a full-page infographic spread for the Columbia Missourian about how COVID-19 impacted the airline industry. I analyzed all the data use for the project, as well. The spread was a semester long project that I worked on while learning the basics of data visualizations and graphic design.</p>

    <h3>Windfarm locator map</h3>
      <section class="img_clips">
      <img src="windfarm.PNG" alt="A locator map shows the acreage that a company bought in Howard County, Missouri to install a windfarm">
      </section>
        <p>I was assigned what appeared as a simple locator map. However, I worked closely with the reported in gathering all the acreage map data for land leased to a company creating a windfarm across two Missouri counties. The acreage maps weren’t online, so I had to use physical images of the acreage maps, taken by the reporter from Howard County’s acreage map book.</p>
          </br>
        <p>I had to trace over each individual piece of land and ensure that each trace was proportional, as the images I had were taken at different distances and angles. I’m especially proud of this graphic, as it hides all that complexity with a simple and clear design.</p>
    <h3>Data analysis on vaccines in rural Missouri counties</h3>
      <p>I worked with the Columbia Missourian’s state government section in providing data analysis for a story they pitched on the state of vaccinations in rural counties. The data analysis helped guide them towards which counties they wanted to visit and report on. I also used the data in visualizations that I assigned to members of the graphics section.</p>
        <br>
      <p>There was a bunch of behind-the-scenes visualizations that I used to find any trends and potential leads for the story. The end result was that there weren’t any major trends, teaching me a valuable lesson: There’s often not a clear-cut trend in data.</p>

    <h3>Bike boom during COVID-19</h3>
      <p>I was a reporter during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wrote a feature story on Columbia’s bike boom, which was spurred because of citywide/nationwide lockdown orders. It was also a collaborative piece, as a peer reporter helped gather interviews for the piece. I wrote the text of the story.</p>
